<h3>Goal</h3>
<blockquote>
The goal of this phase is to learn the basics of device drivers,
and extend our OS services to peripheral devices.
</blockquote>

<h3>Device Driver</h3>
<ol>
<li>
A peripheral device is often coupled with the software in form
of interrupt services. This method has the advantage of the kernel
having to serve multiple tasks and still being in control of the
handling. The kernel can even time the I/O and issue a time-out
to abort certain tasks should the devices lost connection or
communications.
<p>
<li>
To handle an I/O device which is much slower than a CPU, the driver
usually waits for its readiness. The service call to output to two
terminals can be done using the existing sys_write() but with an
I/O number: <i>TERM1 35 (port 0x2f8)</i> and <i>TERM2 36 (port 0x3e8)</i>
(instead of <i>STDOUT</i>).
<p>
<li>
The original service <i>WriteService()</i> will extend its function,
upon the input being TERM1 or TERM2: copy the string to be printed
to the terminal output buffer, and block the running process. And,
the <i><b>TermService()</i></b> is called to start the printing.
<p>
<li>
As the TermService() executes, it only writes out one character
from the output buffer to the the data register in the terminal port.
And this triggers yet another interrupt signal (writing to the port),
and makes TermService() run again to process yet another character.
As the whole string is done, the service code will release the original
waiting process.
<p>
<li>
In the above software configuration, the WriteService() is the upper
half of the device driver, while TermService() lower half.
<p>
<li>
Programming details are depicted in </i>CodingHints.txt</i>. Your code
must be able to output to two terminals by PID: UserProc() with odd number
PID use TERM1, even TERM2.
<p>
<li>
The WriteService

</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<blockquote>
<li>
As before, the source code is to be submitted to your designated Voyager dropbox.
Your result must be able to write to two terminals by PID: odd number TERM1, even
TERM2.
<p>
<li>
Usage of code from the past will be deemed as plagiarism. Not meeting requirements
will incur significant grade point penalty.
</blockquote>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<blockquote>
<li>
Can an inefficient busy-wait WriteService() be made with a long waiting
time instead of the interrupt-driven method? How can it be done?
<p>
<li>
Expand from above, the concept of a "cooperative" OS (C.F. "preemptive"):
voluntary sleep/delay calls, requesting to lower own scheduling priority
(the "nice" unix command).
<p>
<li>
Can range checks on input arguments be simply handled just by functions
coded in syscalls.c? What other details in OS can be revealed and entailed
when trying to do so?
